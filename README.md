> "Evolution is not like a normal engineering process,” said Ranganathan, the Joseph Regenstein Professor of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology and Molecular Engineering at the University of Chicago. “In a normal process you have a blueprint and basic principles, and some intelligent being is putting together our past knowledge to build a particular thing.”
> “These powerful data-driven approaches can get the rules of design even as we are trying to understand the how and why,” explained Ranganathan

* Rama Ranganathan used his 20 years of experience understanding how evolution created the proteins that are known today. Using this experience he and his co-founder Andrew Ferguson developed machine-learning models from existing genome databases to generate novel proteins. 

* The field of molecular engineering is hampered by the pace of human imagination and time. With the advent of generative AI, existing genome databases can synthesize novel proteins at breakneck speed.  

* Funding has been sourced from NVentures, Nvidia, OrbiMed, Valor Equity Partners, and Fidelity Investments. [Pitchfork]([https://duckduckgo.com](https://pitchbook.com/profiles/company/433306-00#investors)
  
## Evozyne’s primary function is to develop novel proteins to advance the fields of healthcare, energy, and agriculture.

* By synthesizing innumerable unrecognized protein enzymes and determining their characteristics this technology will innovate in the following areas, but not limited to:

* Dramatic improvements in carbon capture and conversion into usable energy.
* Targeted drug therapy to minimize side effects.
* Conversion of toxic chemicals into inert form for disposal.
* Advances in polymers that do not harm the environment.  

* The Agricultural, biopharmaceutical, industrial, energy, and environmental industries will benefit directly from this technology.  

* The wide swath that these industries cover represent trillions of dollars.

* Evozyne’s Protein Transformer Variational AutoEncoder (ProT-VAE) using NVIDIA BioNeMo produced two validated novel proteins in less than 12 months. 

* A therapeutic biologic with 2.5x acceleration in the speed of absorption.

* Creation of an enzyme for biological CO2 capture that was stable at 141F. 

* A partnership with Takeda Pharmaceuticals has developed a library of novel proteins that created greatly increased efficiencies compared to their bioinspired counter parts. This was achieved in under six months.           

* Leveraging Technologies with Envozyne’s Evolutionary Generative AI Design. 

* CRISPR technology is a genome editing system.  

* Leverages NVIDIA’s BioNeMo Framework that allows the building and customizing of protein structure and prediction. 

## Novel Protein Development Space

* Industry Peers

* Exazyme	
* Aqemia
* Innophore
* Biomatter
* Cambrium
 
* Trends

* The timeframe to adopt a new drug is approximately 2.5 billion dollars and takes between 10-15 years. The trend with AI driven tools will dramatically decrease the cost and time to market.  

* Over the last 10 years there have been hundreds of start-ups founded receiving into the multi-billions of dollars in seed money.

* The future of this technology is modifying the field of biology into an engineering discipline. 

## Successes in Innovation of Novel Protein Development

* Created a therapeutic biologic increasing the efficiency of delivery by 250%. This discovery can be applied to a vast array of engineered novel proteins.

* Developed an enzyme for organic CO2 capture that can withstand high temperatures for use in industrial applications. 



## Unexplored Possibilities

* Evozyne reach is endless in its field. A more specific approach to targeted cancer treatments would both benefit humanity and summarily growth in its business. With greater resources the company would leverage it to greater preeminence.

* Paragon Biosciences, LLC backing Evozyne’s molecular engineering business allows them to focus on engineering and development. While Paragon focuses on the commercialization of the innovations. This tandem along with their strategic collaboration with NVIDIA and Takada pharmaceuticals provides a strong foundation from which it can achieve superlative results for all of humanity.
